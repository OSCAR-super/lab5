##  Program Requirements

1. Applicable age range of oral calculation software: primary school students of all ages (primary school grade 1 to primary school grade 6);  

2. Different difficulty levels are set according to students of different ages. The difficulty levels are as follows:

   (a)Grade 1 to grade 2: addition and subtraction of integers within 100;

   (b)Grades 3 to 4: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers;

   (c)Grades 5 to 6: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division including decimals.

   1. The test questions are automatically and randomly generated by the software;

   2.  The number of test questions is determined by the user;

   3.  After the answer is finished, the software automatically judges the user's scores.  

       

##  Process

At the beginning, we first analyzed the topic and determined the way to achieve the topic. Then, we defined the responsibilities of the team members.   

During the experiment, we met some problems. Here are three of the difficulties we encountered.  

1. We had some problems with how to use GitHub for our teamwork. According to the information collected, Li Yutian of our group first set up a warehouse and invited members of the group. Generally speaking, after receiving the invitation email, you can click "View Invitation" to accept Li Yutian's invitation and enter the group warehouse. But one of the team members couldn't load the invitation screen. We solved this problem by using VPN. 

2. After we have all created our individual branches, we should clone each branch into a local folder. But some of the team members reported wrong operation. Finally, this problem was solved through in-depth study and data collection. 

3. Because this is the first time 5 people group cooperation, we are not very familiar with it. In the division of labor, we have different opinions. Finally, through consultation, we determined their respective responsibilities.     

   

## Team Programming Experience

This is the first time in this class that we have a multi-person team experiment. Unlike a two-person collaboration, an increase in numbers leads to a collision of opinions. Through patient discussion, we finally determined our respective division of labor and enhanced mutual understanding.
